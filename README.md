# Assignment---3-Hypothesis_testing

**1**
A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

     TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %  of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing.  The manager wants to check whether the defective %  varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences

**5**
     Fantaloons Sales managers commented that % of males versus females walking in to the store differ based on day of the week. Analyze the data and determine whether there is evidence at 5 % significance level to support this hypothesis.
